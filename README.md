# Riley Eaton's Personal Resume

This repository is meant to store/serve my personal resume. The LaTeX source code used to build the PDF is provided here as well.

The version available here is a general CV, and more tailored versions may be used for differing applications.

Feel free to use the LaTeX source code to create your own resume. For more details, see the repository license. Thanks for visiting!
